# Ansible Playbook: deploy_printers_conf_to_stores.yml
# Created by: Scott Steele
# Date: 2023-11-25
# Description: 
#   This playbook is designed to deploy printers.conf files to thin client units 
#   based on their store number extracted from the hostname. It ensures that each 
#   thin client in a specific store gets the correct configuration file from a 
#   designated directory. After deployment, it restarts the CUPS service on each unit.
