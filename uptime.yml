# Ansible Playbook: uptime.yml
# Created by: Scott Steele
# Date: 2023-11-21
# Description: 
#   This playbook checks and displays the uptime of all servers listed in the inventory. 
#   It executes the 'uptime' command on each host to gather information about how long 
#   the server has been running without a restart. This can be useful for monitoring 
#   system stability and maintenance needs.
