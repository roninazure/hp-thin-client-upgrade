# Ansible Playbook: backup_store_printers_conf.yml
# Created by: [Your Name]
# Date: 2023-11-22
# Description: 
#   This playbook is designed for backing up the printers.conf files from thin clients in various stores.
#   It first creates folders for each store on the local machine, then fetches the printers.conf file from
#   each thin client and saves it in the corresponding store's folder. The playbook is tailored to handle
#   store numbers extracted from the hostname of each device.
