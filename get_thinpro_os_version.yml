# Ansible Playbook: gather_thinpro_versions.yml
# Created by: Scott Steele
# Description:
#   This playbook is designed to gather the operating system versions from HP ThinPro devices 
#   within the 'stores' group. It retrieves the OS version from each ThinPro device using a command 
#   and stores this information in a temporary file on the Ansible controller. After collecting data 
#   from all devices, it consolidates the information into a single file 'thinpro_versions.txt'. This 
#   approach ensures efficient data collection and aggregation suitable for large-scale infrastructures.
