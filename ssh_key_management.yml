# Ansible Playbook: ssh_key_management.yml
# Created by: Scott Steele
# Date: 2023-11-21
# Description: 
#   This playbook has two main functions: First, it generates an SSH key pair on the localhost 
#   if it does not already exist. Second, it copies the public SSH key to all remote hosts listed 
#   in the inventory. This facilitates key-based authentication for the root user on all hosts, 
#   enhancing security and streamlining access.
